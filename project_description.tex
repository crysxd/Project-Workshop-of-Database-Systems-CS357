\section{Functional specification}
Our project is an implementation of an food delivery system accesible by
a webpage.

\end{figure}
Our system provides to any kind of the
service of searching for restaurants and food avaible for ordering. An user, who is not
logged in the system, can login as a user or
as a restaurant, register an user account and also apply for an restaurant account.
For now the application of a restaurant account will be processed similar to the
registration of an user account.

An user logged in an user account has the following possibilities: search
for restaurants or meals, cancel order, rating a menu after it was
devlivered, modify his/her rating his rating, modifying account details,
order menu, cancel order

An user logged in a restaurant account should be able to add, modify 
his/her menus as well as the account details, cancel and accept order
received from an registered user.

Optional goals: An application process for the restaurants, with 
approvement of an additional kind of user. In addition we would offer
an recommendation system for the user based on the users orders and 
ratings.

\section{Technical specification}
The Server will run on python and we use the Rest interface for communication
between front and back end. For the front end we use HTML, Javascript and CSS.
The database will run on MySQL.
