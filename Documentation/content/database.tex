\chapter{Database}

In this chapter we introduce the different methods we considered for a database representation and give reasons for final choice we made. Then we give a detailed description for our ER model.

%=======================================================================================
\section{Selection of the Database System}
For our database we considered NoSQL and SQL methods. We looked at different NoSQL solutions like MongoDB and CouchDB. Since nobody who was responsible for the database had experience with NoSQL wo chose to stick with the SQL approach. We  wanted to build a slim system. Therefore we first started to use SQLite. At this time we still used Python in the backend. Later in our project Python became no possibility for us anymore so moved to PHP. This also meant that we would change our SQLite system to MySQL, because one of our group members already had experience with this combination. After considering different possibilities we finally arrived back at the standard solution for a database. The advantages are that it is fast, well documented, the community is big and exists already for a long time so a lot of problems have been already discussed. On the other hand MySQL has so many functionalities that often it offers more complex solutions for less complicated problems. For example there is no support for constraints for values in tables in MySQL so that we had to use triggers which are handled way more complicated because they have way more funtionalities.

\section{ER-Model}
    The figure \ref{fig:er_model} is the current state of our database visualized with an ER model.

    An full description of the table will follow but first we explain the naming convention as well as the meaning of the colors in the ER model.

    \setdescription{itemsep=5pt,parsep=0pt,leftmargin=0.5cm, style=sameline}
    \begin{description}
        \item[attribute: (attribute name)] The attribute name is always written in lower case.
        item[primary key: (attribute name)\_pk] The attribute name concated with a '\_pk' at the end.
        \item[foreign key: (table name)\_(attribute name)] The table name is references the name of the table. Every first letter of every word in the table name is written in uppercase.
         \item[foreign key: (table name)\_(attribute name)\_pk] The foreign key name concated with a '\_pk' at the end.
    \end{description}

    The description for the colors of in the ER model.

    \setdescription{itemsep=5pt,parsep=0pt,leftmargin=0.5cm, style=sameline}
    \begin{description}
        \item[yellow] The attribute is a primary key.
        \item[red] The attribute is a foreign key which may not be NULL. The referenced primary key it identified by the name. 
        \item[lightblue] The attribute may not be NULL.

    \section{Static tables}
    In this section we present the tables which are not used for inserts. Instead saving a string repeatedly in intensively used tables we just save an ID and use a static table for mapping this ID to a string. We present the values of the static tables. The Tag table: 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            tag\_id\_pk & meaning & color code & color\\ \hline
            1 & Vegetarian & \#22c13e & light green \\ \hline
            2 & Vegan & \#195805 & dark green \\ \hline
            3 & Pork & \#f97990	& pink \\ \hline
            4 & Cold & \#73b9c1 & light blue \\ \hline
            5 & Kosha & \#6c1547 & purple \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    The Delivery\_State\_Type table: 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{5cm}|}
            \hline
            delivery\_status\_type\_id\_pk & name & meaning \\ \hline
            1 & PENDING & The delivery was ordered by a customer but the restaurant has not seen the delivery yet. \\ \hline
            2 & PROCESSING & The restaurant has seen and accepted the delivery and will proceed with it. \\ \hline
            3 & INDELIVERY & The restaurant sended the delivery out. \\ \hline
            4 & DONE & The delivery has been delivered. \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \section{Views}
    This is a list of Views we use. We basically just use them to avoid the inner joins with the static tables in every request.
    \setdescription{itemsep=5pt,parsep=0pt,leftmargin=0.5cm, style=sameline}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Delivery\_State\_View] Joins the Delivery\_State with Delivery\_State\_Type together.
        \item[Delivery\_View] Joins the Delivery with Delivery\_State together
    \end{description}
