History:

-----08.05.2015-----
Do visitor, customer and restaurant need a session id in our database?
We would just need a session id of a visitor to save his/her shopping basket

A shopping basket would be a delivery status with name 'Unsubmitted'?

-----05.05.2015-----
day table, delivery_status table, category table and tag table removed and now put into documentation

name_of_day in restaurant table deleted

the name of the table is written before the name of the attribute. In SQL code it is better readable. 

there is no delivery state id, because every state is uniquely identyfied by the corresponding delivery and time.

there is no delivery

discussion:
why remove user's primary key from rating?
what does 256 mean?
no comment field, because every message will be autogenerated from the system and is identyfied by the delivery_status_id

I changed the address information to the chinese post standard

I used some parts of this sql style guide http://leshazlewood.com/software-engineering/sql-style-guide/#comment_count , but not 100 percent, I am also not sure yet if I change somethings. When I am sure, I commit naming conventions for SQL.

The id of the user is used as a foreign key only in two tables. So if the users changes his/her phone number we have to update every entry in "rating" and "delivery"related to his/her phone. Since any user won't have a unmanagable large amount of ratings or deliveries, the phone number won't be changed often and the joining will be easier with a natural key, we should consider to just use the phone as a key. On the other hand with a surrogate key, we do not have the trouble of updating. No business intelligence.

Since every dish has a restaurant id, we don't have to add the restaurant id to a rating

Every delivery state should be uniquely defined by the delivery id and the date+time, therefore we don't need an additional surrogate key.

To prevent a large amount of repetive opening hours, we create a many to many relation with a mapping table.

I deleted the spicy parameter and made a tag out of it. I think this easier to handle for us and the user.
