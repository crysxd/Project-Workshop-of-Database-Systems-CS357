# How to install PHP libraries
For managing php library I used https://getcomposer.org/
To use it just go into your home folder of this git project

> curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

And then

> php composer.phar install

You maybe have to use php5 (or the any other version you currently use)

# Used libraries

PHP:
libphonenumber-for-php - https://github.com/giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php
